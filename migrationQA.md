Q: When will the change take place?

A: Things are still currently being developed. However, it is predicted that the new site will go into operation in late August or early September of 2019.


Q: What will change on Visual Studio Education?

A: Videos, tutorials, software information, and tip information will no longer be presented on Facebook. Instead, it will be hosted on the new website in conjunction with our Azure DevOps repositories.


Q: How will this change affect current Facebook users who voted to like the page, and subscribe to notification from the page?

A: We are aware that most of the current user base for the page resides in countries other than the US and we are working with Microsoft on issues where users could be blocked. An update will be provided when we have more information.


Q: What is the reason for the change?

A: Overall, we are moving with the times and we think it’s time to produce a page of our own in which we can measure results, provide content, and grow in ways that we could not do on Facebook.


Q: What factors went into the decision of changing the format?

A: Our biggest factor was a recent poll which was taken. However, there were other contributing factors such as maintaining metrics, and the workflow of the forum. The poll data retrieved in combination with other data taken had the most weight in our decision making.


Q: What exactly will change in the forum?
A: Videos, tutorials, tips, updates, and new information about Visual Studio and related products will be announced on the new site and not the Facebook page. The Facebook page will remain as a presence where users can like us and receive general event information as well as message us. All, other functions will be transferred to the new site.


Q: What will happened to the older content, which is still on the Facebook page?

A: All older content is currently being review, including any videos which were recently presented. While the video currently on Facebook status is in limbo, all older content which is not currently up to date will be removed. All, other content which is up to date and falls into the category within the forum changes will be moved to the new site.

Q: What features will the new site incorporate for users.

A: Users will be able to log into the site and create a site profile. We will have a development blog specifically for the site which users can post their questions and reply to topics. The site will also be linked to our current Azure DevOps repositories where users can download samples of code or they can create their own repository. While there will be other feature these are just the highlights to come.


Q: Will a site login be required?

A: Yes, you will need a site login to view information other than general information. This means tutorials, videos, and posting to our message board. All users will have the choice of registering for a user account or using their Facebook login to access the sites resources.


Q: Will the site be SSL encrypted?

A: Yes, 128-bit encryption will be applied to the site. This includes site monitoring to see where the logins are coming from. The privacy policy and general disclaimers are being rewritten to account for the new changes.


Q: Will there be email verification of new users?

A: All user will be email verified. When registering, they will receive a notification provided they are using a real email address. This includes Facebook users as the email address will be part of the necessary information to access our resources. They will have to click on the link provided to fully register their new account in a secure manner.


Q: Are their methods in place to reduce spammers, hackers, or those who’s intent is to circumvent the site in general?

A: Yes, new users who are emailed a link to verify their email, Facebook, or Microsoft account identity will have 30 minutes to respond to the verification link or code which is sent. This includes mobile devices. After 30 minutes have elapsed, any account which is attempted to be created will automatically be deleted. In addition, any account which is dormant for a concretive too month time period or any duplicate accounts found belonging to the same user will also be removed as to the new policy which will go into effect when the site goes into production.


Q: Will users be able to submit content, and do you claim ownership of any content submitted?

A: Yes and no. Users will be able to submit content to the site as they were given permission to do so on the Facebook page. The answer to the second part of the question is no, we will not be taking ownership of any content which is submitted. Provided that the owner of the content, which is submitted either has the content copyrighted, or has rights such as “Creative Commons” which we will introduce once the site is in operation. We encourage anyone who is submitting content and if it is copyrighted to make sure that all rights are clearly labeled on their material. Otherwise, it will be labeled as “Public Domain”.
