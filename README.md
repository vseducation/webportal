# Welcome to Visual Studio Education

Hello, world

As you may or may not be aware. Visual Studio Education will be changing its format soon.

This is a change which has been in progress for some time, but other projects took priority. In short, videos, examples, tutorials, and all blog updates going forward will be ported to the new website currently under construction. While our Facebook page will remain as a presence for any Facebook information, all other functions will be taken over by the new website.

For additional information about the migration, please see our migrationQA.md document which contains anticipated questions and answers.

For those who have any questions about the migration not listed on the migrationQA.md document. Please post them on our Facebook page, or use the Facebook messenger on our page to send us a message.

You can also check this Github repository frequently for any updates on the new website construction and progress.
